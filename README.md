# Plan it Right!
Create a Schedule Planning website that contains a calendar, a clock and a list of tasks to be completed. The Website should allow the users to store different tasks on any day selected in the calendar. In addition, all the tasks should be stored in the user's computer even after the Web Browser is closed.

## Basic Mode:
- [x] The Website should contain the three essential components â€“ a calendar to select any particular date of choice, a clock showing the current time and a To-do list with the set of tasks for each day.
- [x] Users should be able to create and delete any tasks in the list.
- [x] The tasks, along with the date on which they are planned, should be stored in the browser's Local Storage.
- [x] The Clock should be a digital clock with the current time correctly displayed. The styling of the Clock should be done using HTML and CSS only.

## Hacker Mode:
- [ ] Add a tracker with the Todo list, which would notify the user if the task is pending or completed. The tasks should contain a deadline time. Have a separate pending list for the day's task.
- [x] Add an option to view the Clock in either analog or digital format. The Analog clock should be shaped like a circle, and all the numbers should be aligned appropriately. Only HTML and CSS should be used for the styling of the Clock.
- [ ] Multiple user functionality should be present. Make sure the different users have their data stored separately and shown correctly on the Website.
- [x] The Clock should have additional user interactivity. Add sound effects, options to change colour, dimensions of the clock hands as per user's input, etc. Add an option for the user to modify the clock timing as well. (Customisation)

## Git
- [x] Use git bash or command-line interface instead of git website for making commits.
- [x] Work on a new repository for the project.
- [x] Include meaningful commit messages for each commit made in the repository.
- [x] For the basic task work on the main branch.
- [x] Once done with the basic task, create a separate branch called hacker mode from the main branch and continue working on that branch.
- [x] Have a proper Readme consisting of the given sub-tasks as a checklist and update them accordingly.
